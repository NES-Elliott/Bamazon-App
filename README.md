And then you are prompted with a successful purchase! Enjoy your copy of Odessey!

## Manager's Guide
As the manager, you want the ability to change the information in the database. So here is how you do that:

Here you are prompted with 4 options:
+ Viewing the products for sale
+ Checking low inventory
+ Adding to the inventory of an existing product
+ Adding a product for sale

These functions give you the ability to run your Bamazon like you want!

There is also a quit option should you choose to exit the prompt.
